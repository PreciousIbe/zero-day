This Project helps you to understand how to use Virtual Machines and Vagrant on your personal computers. It helps to run different programs with different versions.

Virtual machine is the emulation/virtualization of a computer system they are based on computer architectures and they provide functionality of a physical computer.
```
 * VirtualBox is a virtual machine provider that is used by themselves, it is free and lightweight
 * Vagrants like VirtualBox is free, reliable and well maintained. It is a tool that sits on a Virtual machine provider.

  Virtual Machines are mostly of 2 types: **System Virtual Machines** and **Process Virtual Machines**
### System Virtual Machines
  They provide substitute for a real machine. It grew out of the time sharing system. The physical hardware running this VM is called the host while the VM emulated is referred to as the guest.
### Process Virtual Machines
  They are designed to computer programs in a platform independent environment. It is not strictly VM because apps running on top still have access to all Operating systems services and are therefore not confined to the system model.
